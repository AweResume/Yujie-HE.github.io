As the core component of most trackers, CF is a discriminative classifier to distinguish the object from the surrounding environment. However, the poor representation of the object and lack of contextual information have restricted the tracker to gain better performance. In this work, a robust framework with multi-kernelized correlators is proposed to improve robustness and accuracy simultaneously. Both convolutional features extracted from the neural network and hand-crafted features are employed to enhance expressions for object appearances. Then, the adaptive context analysis strategy helps filters to effectively learn the surrounding information by introducing context patches with the GMSD index. In the training stage, multiple dynamic filters with time-attenuated factors are introduced to avoid tracking failure caused by dramatic appearance changes. The response maps corresponding to different features are finally fused before the novel resolution enhancement operation to increase distinguishing capability. As a result, the optimization problem is reformulated, and a closed-form solution for the proposed framework can be obtained in the kernel space. Extensive experiments on 100 challenging UAV tracking sequences demonstrate the proposed tracker outperforms other 23 state-of-the-art trackers and can effectively handle unexpected appearance variations under the complex and constantly changing working conditions.","tags":["Visual tracking","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Multi-kernelized correlators","Adaptive context analysis","Dynamic weighted filters"],"title":"Robust multi-kernelized correlators for UAV tracking with adaptive context analysis and dynamic weighted filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changhong Fu","Fuling Lin","Fan Li","Yujie He"],"categories":null,"content":"\nComparison between traditional CF-based and proposed SPCF tracker\n\n","date":1569801600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569801600,"objectID":"885aa35a9654e3a8444e0e183be373c5","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/publication/2019_spcf_irosw/","publishdate":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_spcf_irosw/","section":"publication","summary":"Correlation Filters (CF) have recently demonstrated promising performance in terms of rapidly tracking objects for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in different types of UAV tracking tasks. The strength of the approach comes from its ability to learn how the object is changing over time efficiently. However, due to heavy dependence on the quality of the training set and the lack of real negative training samples, the object appearance model may be easily interfered by the corrupted training samples, which can result in suboptimal performance. Besides, limited by the representation of a single feature, the tracking model may fail to cope with the complex surrounding environment and considerable appearance variation of the object. In this work, the principal causes behind the problems of the abundance of object representation and purity of training samples have been tackled, to simultaneously improve both discriminative power and anti-disturbance capability of the tracking model. Comprehensive experiments on 100 challenging UAV image sequences have demonstrated that the novel sample purifying tracker based on cooperative features learning, i.e., SPCF tracker, outperforms 15 state-of-the-art trackers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, the presented SPCF tracker is designed for object tracking and employed in UAV tracking tasks for the first time.","tags":["Correlation filter","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Sample purification"],"title":"Sample Purification-Aware Correlation Filters for UAV Tracking with Cooperative Deep Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Teaching Assistant from Sep. 2018 - Jan. 2019\n  Assisted first-year students major in Industrial Design to get started Arduino Hardware and Programming\n Designed a series of the electromechanical modules for Industrial Design students\n Gave lectures on basic mechanical principle with Arduino hardware and programming and advanced RGBD sensors for the semester project\n  The following video is Mechatronics Module Experiments.\n\n \n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5fb85218b7c762be752eebb403211af0","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2019-tongji-ta/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2019-tongji-ta/","section":"project","summary":"Acted as TA for freshmen in [College of Design \u0026 Innovation](http://tjdi.tongji.edu.cn/)","tags":["Mechatronics"],"title":"Teaching Assistant in Open Source Hardware and Programming","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Powertrain Group Leader from Sep. 2016 - Dec. 2018\n  Designed and optimized the overall powertrain system to ensure China\u0026rsquo;s first leading four-wheel-drive Formula Student Racecar, achieving an 8\\% efficiency and 10\\% lightweight improvement Participated FSEC 2017 - 2018 and SFJ 2018 as Chief Powertrain Engineer, contributing to DIAN Racing‘s win in first place in Engineering Design and Efficiency Prize, and Best Powertrain Award from 2017 to 2018  The following video is virtual assembly of DRe18，which was what I worked for as Powertrain Group Leader.\n\n  Design Report Final @ FSEC19 \n","date":1546214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546214400,"objectID":"82d14568390f43b7be1a421e74f001ca","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2018-dian-racing/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-dian-racing/","section":"project","summary":"Built First leading 4WD Formula Student Racecar in China.","tags":["Mechatronics","Racecar"],"title":"DIAN Racing Formula Student Electric Team","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Robotics Algorithm Development Intern from Jul. 2018 - Aug. 2018\n  Implemented sensor fusion between Pandar40 (a 40-channel LiDAR) and gyroscope and achieved a 5% accuracy improvements on top of state-of-the-art SLAM framework and drew a 3D point cloud map of Tongji University Jiading Campus below 10m Deployed control, decision, and communication algorithms for a self-developed skid steer wheel robot, realizing autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in a $ 300 m^2 $ workspace  \n Indoor SLAM @ Hesai\n\n Debugging the robot\n\n Jiading Campus Satellite Map corresponding to the map generated from Pandar40 \n\n","date":1546214400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546214400,"objectID":"2cf2900a21859645e66bc3bb95d82458","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2018-hesai-internship/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-hesai-internship/","section":"project","summary":"Implemented Outdoor SLAM @ Tongji Jiading Campus and Indoor Autonomous Navigation .","tags":["Robotics","Computer Vision","LiDAR"],"title":"SLAM and Autonomous Navigation for Skid Steer Wheel Robot","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Manager \u0026amp; Mechanical Development Leader from Oct. 2016 - Jun. 2018\n  Designed two main robots to participate in national mobile robot competition, RoboMaster, achieving lightweight and stability of the chassis and 3DOF pan-tilt mechanism and multi-robot interaction Optimized structural design to enhance operation stability and achieve lightweight, enable the robots flexible operation and combating under complicated circumstances  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"26fb77baca14eeca774e060f789d6ff1","permalink":"https://yujie-he.github.io/project/2018-super-power/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-super-power/","section":"project","summary":"Designed robots to combat in RoboMaster.","tags":["Mechatronics","Robotics"],"title":"Super Power Robot Team","type":"project"}]
